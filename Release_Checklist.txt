SUNDIALS Pre-Release Tasks

This is a list of tasks that need to be done before a SUNDIALS release.
The order is bottom-up-- starting with solver source files, and ending with
web pages.

0. Create release branch from trunk in the Subversion repository

1. Bug fixes - C solvers

2. Bug fixes - Matlab (This is no longer maintained as of 2016)

3. Bug fixes - installation

4. Documentation fixes

5. Bug fixes - examples

6. Misc. source file fixes

7. Update the "Changes in ..." sections in all user guides.

8. Update README file in src/<solver>, with version
   number and release dates at the top and bottom
   of the file.
    src/arkode/README
    src/cvode/README
    src/cvodes/README
    src/ida/README
    src/idas/README
    src/kinsol/README

9. Update version numbers of third party libraries in Install Guide
   in doc directory.

10. Update version numbers in source code, documentation, and tarscripts.
    doc/arkode/ARKode_example.tex
    doc/arkode/ARKode.tex
    doc/arkode/SphinxDocs/examples/source/conf.py
    doc/sundials/ug.tex
    doc/sundials/biblio.bib (and year if necessary)
    html/main.html (This is no longer maintained as of at least 2016)
    scripts/tarscript
    sundialsTB/install_STB.m (This is no longer maintained as of 2016)
    CMakeLists.txt
    README.md
    README_DEV

11. Create the tarballs
   Create the new distribution tarballs using the "tarscript" shell script
   under scripts/.  This also compiles the documents (user guides and example
   docs) and creates all tarballs in their final form, appropriate for
   uploading to the website.

12. Update Internal Drupal Web pages for SUNDIALS:
     https://computation-external.llnl.gov/user

  a) Modify content (save edits on each page as you go)
       - Edit Main Page: https://computation-external.llnl.gov/projects/sundials
           + Update Release History page:
             https://computation-external.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/release-history
           + Add list of primary changes and child page containing
             full list of changes (this information is shared with
             "Changes in ..." sections of user guides).

       - Edit Download Page:
         https://computation-external.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/sundials-software
           + Update main download table with new versions of solvers and
             new sizes
           + Upload new documentation (pdf) files.
           + Update Previous releases table with new entry for previous
             release of full SUNDIALS suite.

       - Edit Usage Notes Example Page if major release:
           + Upload new cvRoberts_dns_negsol.c, cvDisc_dns.c, and cvsRoberts_FSA_dns_Switch.c
             examples.

       - Edit FAQ if necessary:
         https://computation-external.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/faq

  b) Once each sub page is complete, ask for team review of draft pages.
     https://computation-external.llnl.gov/projects/sundials

  c)  After team comments are included and saved, select the
      "Publishing options" button in the bottom left group of buttons on the
      draft page.  Select the Moderation state reflecting the amount of
      required review then Save.  This must be done for each page and is the
      final action before pages are uploaded for external release.

13. After final push, ensure web content and behavior is as expected:
       + Main Page: http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials

14. Tag the release in the release branch in the Subversion repository

Old stuff:

9. Create PDF files for SundialsTB
    a) Create the PDF doc for SundialsTB by running the Matlab program texdoc.m
    available in sundialsTB/doc.
    b) The program uses the m2html toolbox, freely available.
       It creates doc files in PS and PDF formats as sundialsTB.ps and
       sundialsTB.pdf.
    c) Follow Radu's instructions in sundials/sundialsTB/doc/README_texdoc
