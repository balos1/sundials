=======================
Matrix Data Structures
=======================

The SUNDIALS library comes packaged with a variety of ``SUNMatrix``
implementations, designed for simulations requiring direct linear
solvers for problems in serial or shared-memory parallel
environments.  SUNDIALS additionally provides a simple interface for
generic matrices (akin to a C++ *abstract base class*).  All of the
major SUNDIALS packages (CVODE(s), IDA(s), KINSOL, ARKODE), are
constructed to only depend on these generic matrix operations, making
them immediately extensible to new user-defined matrix objects.  For
each of the SUNDIALS-provided matrix types, SUNDIALS also provides at
least two ``SUNLinearSolver`` implementations that factor these
matrix objects and use them in the solution of linear systems.
