\index{CVODE@{\cvode}!package structure}
The {\cvode} package is written in ANSI {\CC}. The following
summarizes the basic structure of the package, although knowledge
of this structure is not necessary for its use.

The overall organization of the {\cvode} package is shown in Figure
\ref{f:cvorg}.

  Modules specific to {\cvode} begin with ``CV'' ({\cvls},  {\cvnls}, {\cvdiag},
  {\cvbbdpre}, and {\cvbandpre}), all other items correspond to generic
  {\sundials} vector, matrix, and solver modules (see Figure \ref{f:sunorg1}).}

The central integration module, implemented in the files \id{cvode.h},
\id{cvode\_impl.h}, and \id{cvode.c}, deals with the evaluation of integration
coefficients, estimation of local
error, selection of stepsize and order, and interpolation to user output
points, among other issues.

{\cvode} utilizes generic linear and nonlinear solver modules defined by the
{\sunlinsol} API (see Chapter \ref{s:sunlinsol}) and {\sunnonlinsol} API (see
Chapter \ref{c:sunnonlinsol}) respectively. As such, {\cvode} has no knowledge
of the method being used to solve the linear and nonlinear systems that
arise. For any given user problem, there exists a single nonlinear solver
interface and, if necessary, one of the linear system solver interfaces is
specified, and invoked as needed during the integration.

\index{CVODE@{\cvode} linear solver interfaces|(}
At present, the package includes two linear solver interfaces.  The
primary linear solver interface, {\cvls}, supports both direct and
iterative linear solvers built using the generic {\sunlinsol} API (see
Chapter \ref{s:sunlinsol}).  These solvers may utilize a {\sunmatrix}
object (see Chapter \ref{s:sunmatrix}) for storing Jacobian
information, or they may be matrix-free. Since {\cvode} can operate on
any valid {\sunlinsol} implementation, the set of linear solver
modules available to {\cvode} will expand as new {\sunlinsol} modules
are developed.

Additionally, {\cvode} includes the {\em diagonal} linear solver
interface, {\cvdiag}, that creates an internally generated diagonal
approximation to the Jacobian.
\index{CVODE@{\cvode} linear solver interfaces|)}

For users employing dense or banded Jacobian matrices, {\cvode}
includes algorithms for their approximation through difference
quotients, although the user also has the option of supplying a
routine to compute the Jacobian (or an approximation to it) directly.
This user-supplied routine is required when using sparse or
user-supplied Jacobian matrices.

For users employing matrix-free iterative linear solvers,
\index{Jacobian-vector product!setup and solve phases} {\cvode}
includes an algorithm for the approximation by difference quotients of
the product $Mv$. Again, the user has the option of providing routines
for this operation, in two phases: setup (preprocessing of Jacobian
data) and multiplication.

For preconditioned iterative methods, \index{preconditioning!setup and solve phases}
the preconditioning must be supplied by the user, again in two phases:
setup and solve.  While\index{preconditioning!advice on} there is no
default choice of preconditioner analogous to the difference-quotient
approximation in the direct case, the references
\cite{BrHi:89,Byr:92}, together with the example and demonstration
programs included with {\cvode}, offer considerable assistance in
building preconditioners.

\index{CVODE@{\cvode} linear solvers!implementation details|(}
{\cvode}'s linear solver interface consists of four primary phases,
devoted to (1) memory allocation and initialization, (2) setup of the
matrix data involved, (3) solution of the system, and (4) freeing of memory.
The setup and solution phases are separate because the evaluation of
Jacobians and preconditioners is done only periodically during the
integration, and only as required to achieve convergence.
\index{CVODE@{\cvode} linear solvers!implementation details|)}

{\cvode} also provides two preconditioner modules, for use with any of
the Krylov iterative linear solvers. The first one, {\cvbandpre},
is intended to be used with {\nvecs}, {\nvecopenmp} or {\nvecpthreads}
and provides a banded difference-quotient Jacobian-based
preconditioner, with corresponding setup and solve routines.
The second preconditioner module, {\cvbbdpre}, works in conjunction
with {\nvecp} and generates a preconditioner that is a block-diagonal
matrix with each block being a banded matrix.

All state information used by {\cvode} to solve a given problem is saved
in a structure, and a pointer to that structure is returned to the
user.  There is no global data in the {\cvode} package, and so, in this
respect, it is reentrant. State information specific to the linear
solver is saved in a separate structure, a pointer to which resides in
the {\cvode} memory structure. The reentrancy of {\cvode} was motivated
by the anticipated multicomputer extension, but is also essential
in a uniprocessor setting where two or more problems are solved by
intermixed calls to the package from within a single user program.
