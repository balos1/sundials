\section{SUNDIALS Release License}

All {\sundials} packages are released open source, under the BSD 3-Clause
license. The only requirements of the license are preservation of copyright and
a standard disclaimer of liability. The full text of the license and an
additional notice are provided below and may also be found in the LICENSE and
NOTICE files provided with all {\sundials} packages.

{\warn} If you are using {\sundials} with any third
party libraries linked in (e.g., LAPACK, KLU, SuperLU\_MT, {\petsc},
or {\hypre}), be sure to review the respective license of the package as
that license may have more restrictive terms than the {\sundials} license.
For example, if someone builds {\sundials} with a statically linked KLU,
the build is subject to terms of the LGPL license (which is what
KLU is released with) and \textit{not} the {\sundials} BSD license anymore.
