% This is a shared SUNDIALS TEX file with description of
% the SUNDIALS organization
%
The family of solvers referred to as {\sundials} consists of the solvers
{\cvode} and {\arkode} (for ODE systems), {\kinsol} (for nonlinear algebraic
systems), and {\ida} (for differential-algebraic systems).  In addition,
{\sundials} also includes variants of {\cvode} and {\ida} with sensitivity analysis
capabilities (using either forward or adjoint methods), called {\cvodes} and
{\idas}, respectively.

The various solvers of this family share many subordinate modules.
For this reason, it is organized as a family, with a directory
structure that exploits that sharing (see Figures \ref{f:sunorg1} and
\ref{f:sunorg2}).

The following is a list of the solver packages presently available, and
the basic functionality of each:
\begin{itemize}

\item {\cvode},
  a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems $dy/dt = f(t,y)$ based
  on Adams and BDF methods;

\item {\cvodes},
  a solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems with sensitivity analysis capabilities;

\item {\arkode},
  a solver for stiff, nonstiff, mixed stiff-nonstiff, and multirate ODE systems
  $M dy/dt = f_1(t,y) + f_2(t,y)$ based on Runge-Kutta methods;

\item {\ida},
  a solver for differential-algebraic systems $F(t,y,\dot{y}) = 0$ based on BDF methods;

\item {\idas},
  a solver for differential-algebraic systems
  with sensitivity analysis capabilities;

\item {\kinsol},
  a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems $F(u) = 0$.

\end{itemize}
Note for modules that provide interfaces to third-party libraries (i.e., LAPACK,
{\klu}, {\superlumt}, {\superludist}, {\hypre}, {\petsc}, {\trilinos}, and
{\raja}) users will need to download and compile those packages independently.
