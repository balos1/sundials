============

Naming conventions
------------------

All exported symbols that will be publically available must be namespaced appropriately!

- ``sun`` for typedef's to native types (e.g., ``sunindextype``)
- ``SUN_`` for macros
- ``SUN`` for functions that are not class functions (see :ref:`Style.Classes` for class naming conventions)
- ``SUN`` for types that are non-native (e.g., ``SUNDlsMat``)
- ``sundials::`` for C++ code (nesting under `sundials::` is OK)
- ``sundials::<somename>::impl`` for C++ code that is private (implementation only)

TODO Comments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following the Google Style Guide [GoogleStyle]_, TODO comments are used to note
code that is "temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect."

A consistent TODO comment format provides an easy to search for keyword with
details on how to get more information. TODO comments should start with ``TODO``
followed by a unique identifier, enclosed in parentheses, for the person most
knowledgeable about the issue and a brief description of the TODO item.
Generally, these comments should be used sparingly and are not a substitute for
creating an issue or bug report. When applicable, the comment should include the
relevant issue or bug report number.

Examples:

.. code-block:: c

   /* TODO(DJG): Update to new API in the next major release (Issue #256) */
