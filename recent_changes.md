# SUNDIALS Changelog

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.8.0

Added specialized fused HIP kernels to CVODE which may offer better
performance on smaller problems when using CVODE with the `NVECTOR_HIP`
module. See the optional input function `CVodeSetUseIntegratorFusedKernels`
for more information. As with other SUNDIALS HIP features, this is
feature is experimental and may change from version to version.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.7.0

The installed SUNDIALSConfig.cmake file now supports the `COMPONENTS` option
to `find_package`.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.7.0

A new NVECTOR implementation based on the SYCL abstraction layer has been added
targeting Intel GPUs. At present the only SYCL compiler supported is the DPC++
(Intel oneAPI) compiler. See the SYCL NVECTOR section in the user guide for more
details. This module is considered experimental and is subject to major changes
even in minor releases.

A new SUNMatrix and SUNLinearSolver implementation were added to interface
with the MAGMA linear algebra library. Both the matrix and the linear solver
support general dense linear systems as well as block diagonal linear systems,
and both are targeted at GPUs (AMD or NVIDIA).

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.6.1

Fixed a bug in the SUNDIALS CMake which caused an error
if the CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD and SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS options
were not provided.

Fixed some compiler warnings when using the IBM XL compilers.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.6.0

A new NVECTOR implementation based on the AMD ROCm HIP platform has been added.
This vector can target NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. See HIP NVECTOR section in the user
guide for more details. This module is considered experimental and is subject to
change from version to version.

The RAJA NVECTOR implementation has been updated to support the HIP backend
in addition to the CUDA backend. Users can choose the backend when configuring
SUNDIALS by using the `SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS` CMake variable. This module
remains experimental and is subject to change from version to version.

A new optional operation, `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer`, was added to the N_Vector
API. This operation is useful for N_Vectors that utilize dual memory spaces,
e.g. the native SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector.

The SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE and SUNLINEARSOLVER_CUSOLVERSP_BATCHQR implementations
no longer require the SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector. Instead, they require that the vector
utilized provides the `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` operation, and that the pointer
returned by `N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` is a valid CUDA device pointer.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.5.0

Refactored the SUNDIALS build system. CMake 3.12.0 or newer is now required.
Users will likely see deprecation warnings, but otherwise the changes
should be fully backwards compatible for almost all users. SUNDIALS
now exports CMake targets and installs a SUNDIALSConfig.cmake file.

Added support for SuperLU DIST 6.3.0 or newer.


## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.4.0

Added full support for time-dependent mass matrices in ARKStep, and expanded
existing non-identity mass matrix infrastructure to support use of the
fixed point nonlinear solver.  Fixed bug for ERK method integration with
static mass matrices.

An interface between ARKStep and the XBraid multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT)
library has been added to enable parallel-in-time integration. See the ARKStep
documentation and examples for more details. This interface required the
addition of three new N_Vector operations to exchange vector data between
computational nodes, see `N_VBufSize`, `N_VBufPack`, and `N_VBufUnpack`. These
N_Vector operations are only used within the XBraid interface and need not be
implemented for any other context.

Updated the MRIStep time-stepping module in ARKode to support
higher-order MRI-GARK methods [Sandu, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 57, 2019],
including methods that involve solve-decoupled, diagonally-implicit
treatment of the slow time scale.

A new API, `SUNMemoryHelper`, was added to support **GPU users** who have complex
memory management needs such as using memory pools. This is paired with new
constructors for the `NVECTOR_CUDA` and `NVECTOR_RAJA` modules that accept a
`SUNMemoryHelper` object. Refer to "The SUNMemoryHelper API", "NVECTOR CUDA"
and "NVECTOR RAJA" sections in the documentation for more information.

The `NVECTOR_RAJA` module has been updated to mirror the `NVECTOR_CUDA` module.
Notably, the update adds managed memory support to the `NVECTOR_RAJA` module.
Users of the module will need to update any calls to the `N_VMake_Raja` function
because that signature was changed. This module remains experimental and is
subject to change from version to version.

Added new `SetLSNormFactor()` functions to CVODE(S), ARKODE, and IDA(S) to
to specify the factor for converting between integrator tolerances (WRMS norm)
and linear solver tolerances (L2 norm) i.e., `tol_L2 = nrmfac * tol_WRMS`.

Added new reset functions `ARKStepReset()`, `ERKStepReset()`, and
`MRIStepReset()` to reset the stepper time and state vector to user-provided
values for continuing the integration from that point while retaining the
integration history. These function complement the reinitialization functions
`ARKStepReInit()`, `ERKStepReInit()`, and `MRIStepReInit()` which reinitialize
the stepper so that the problem integration should resume as if started from
scratch.

Added new functions for advanced users providing a custom `SUNNonlinSolSysFn`.

The expected behavior of `SUNNonlinSolGetNumIters` and
`SUNNonlinSolGetNumConvFails` in the SUNNonlinearSolver API have been updated to
specify that they should return the number of nonlinear solver iterations and
convergence failures in the most recent solve respectively rather than the
cumulative number of iterations and failures across all solves respectively. The
API documentation and SUNDIALS provided SUNNonlinearSolver implementations and
have been updated accordingly. As before, the cumulative number of nonlinear
iterations and failures may be retreived by calling the integrator provided get
functions.

**This change may cause a runtime error in existing user code**.
In IDAS and CVODES, the functions for forward integration with checkpointing
(`IDASolveF`, `CVodeF`) are now subject to a restriction on the number of time
steps allowed to reach the output time. This is the same restriction applied to
the `IDASolve` and `CVode` functions. The default maximum number of steps is
500, but this may be changed using the `<IDA|CVode>SetMaxNumSteps` function.
This change fixes a bug that could cause an infinite loop in the `IDASolveF`
and `CVodeF` and functions.

A minor inconsistency in CVODE(S) and a bug ARKODE when checking the Jacobian
evaluation frequency has been fixed. As a result codes using using a
non-default Jacobian update frequency through a call to
`CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac` or `ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenJac` will need to
increase the provided value by 1 to achieve the same behavior as before. For
greater clarity the functions `CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac`,
`ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenJac`, and `ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet` have been
deprecated and replaced with `CVodeSetJacEvalFrequency`,
`ARKStepSetJacEvalFrequency`, and `ARKStepSetLSetupFrequency` respectively.
Additionally, the function `CVodeSetLSetupFrequency` has been added to CVODE(S)
to set the frequency of calls to the linear solver setup function.

The `NVECTOR_TRILINOS` module has been updated to work with Trilinos 12.18+.
This update changes the local ordinal type to always be an `int`.

Added support for CUDA v11.


## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.3.0

Fixed a bug in ARKode where the prototypes for `ERKStepSetMinReduction()` and
`ARKStepSetMinReduction()` were not included in `arkode_erkstep.h` and
`arkode_arkstep.h` respectively.

Fixed a bug in ARKode where inequality constraint checking would need to be
disabled and then re-enabled to update the inequality constraint values after
resizing a problem. Resizing a problem will now disable constraints and a call
to `ARKStepSetConstraints` or `ERKStepSetConstraints` is required to re-enable
constraint checking for the new problem size.

Fixed a bug in the iterative linear solver modules where an error is not
returned if the Atimes function is `NULL` or, if preconditioning is enabled, the
PSolve function is `NULL`.

Added specialized fused CUDA kernels to CVODE which may offer better
performance on smaller problems when using CVODE with the `NVECTOR_CUDA`
module. See the optional input function `CVodeSetUseIntegratorFusedKernels`
for more information. As with other SUNDIALS CUDA features, this is
feature is experimental and may change from version to version.

Added the ability to control the CUDA kernel launch parameters for the
`NVECTOR_CUDA` and `SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE` modules. These modules remain
experimental and are subject to change from version to version.
In addition, the `NVECTOR_CUDA` kernels were rewritten to be more flexible.
Most users should see equivalent performance or some improvement, but a select
few may observe minor performance degradation with the default settings. Users
are encouraged to contact the SUNDIALS team about any perfomance changes
that they notice.

Added new capabilities for monitoring the solve phase in the `SUNNONLINSOL_NEWTON`
and `SUNNONLINSOL_FIXEDPOINT` modules, and the SUNDIALS iterative linear solver
modules. SUNDIALS must be built with the CMake option
`SUNDIALS_BUILD_WITH_MONITORING` to use these capabilties.

Added a new function, `CVodeSetMonitorFn`, that takes a user-function
to be called by CVODE after every `nst` succesfully completed time-steps.
This is intended to provide a way of monitoring the CVODE statistics
throughout the simulation.

Added a new function `CVodeGetLinSolveStats` to get the CVODE linear solver
statistics as a group.

Added optional set functions to provide an alternative ODE right-hand side
function (ARKode and CVODE(S)), DAE residual function (IDA(S)), or nonlinear
system function (KINSOL) for use when computing Jacobian-vector products with
the internal difference quotient approximation.

Added support to CVODE for integrating IVPs with constraints using BDF methods
and projecting the solution onto the constraint manifold with a user defined
projection function. This implementation is accompanied by additions to the
CVODE user documentation and examples.


## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.2.0

Fixed a build system bug related to the Fortran 2003 interfaces when using the
IBM XL compiler. When building the Fortran 2003 interfaces with an XL compiler
it is recommended to set `CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` to `f2003`, `xlf2003`, or
`xlf2003_r`.

Fixed a bug in how ARKode interfaces with a user-supplied, iterative, unscaled linear solver.
In this case, ARKode adjusts the linear solver tolerance in an attempt to account for the
lack of support for left/right scaling matrices.  Previously, ARKode computed this scaling
factor using the error weight vector, `ewt`; this fix changes that to the residual weight vector,

Fixed a linkage bug affecting Windows users that stemmed from dllimport/dllexport
attribute missing on some SUNDIALS API functions.

Fixed a bug in how ARKode interfaces with a user-supplied, iterative, unscaled linear solver.
In this case, ARKode adjusts the linear solver tolerance in an attempt to account for the
lack of support for left/right scaling matrices.  Previously, ARKode computed this scaling
factor using the error weight vector, `ewt`; this fix changes that to the residual weight vector,
`rwt`, that can differ from `ewt` when solving problems with non-identity mass matrix.

Fixed a similar bug in how ARKode interfaces with scaled linear solvers when solving problems
with non-identity mass matrices.  Here, the left scaling matrix should correspond with `rwt`
and the right scaling matrix with `ewt`; these were reversed but are now correct.

Fixed a memory leak in CVODES and IDAS from not deallocating the `atolSmin0` and
`atolQSmin0` arrays.

Fixed a bug where a non-default value for the maximum allowed growth factor
after the first step would be ignored.

Functions were added to each of the time integration packages to enable or
disable the scaling applied to linear system solutions with matrix-based linear solvers
to account for lagged matrix information.

Added two new functions, `ARKStepSetMinReduction()` and
`ERKStepSetMinReduction()` to change the minimum allowed step size reduction factor
after an error test failure.

Added a new `SUNMatrix` implementation, `SUNMATRIX_CUSPARSE`, that interfaces
to the sparse matrix implementation from the NVIDIA cuSPARSE library. In addition,
the `SUNLINSOL_CUSOLVER_BATCHQR` linear solver has been updated to
use this matrix, therefore, users of this module will need to update their code.
These modules are still considered to be experimental, thus they are subject to
breaking changes even in minor releases.

Added a new "stiff" interpolation module to ARKode, based on Lagrange polynomial interpolation,
that is accessible to each of the ARKStep, ERKStep and MRIStep time-stepping modules.
This module is designed to provide increased interpolation accuracy when integrating
stiff problems, as opposed to the ARKode-standard Hermite interpolation module that
can suffer when the IVP right-hand side has large Lipschitz constant.  While the Hermite module
remains the default, the new Lagrange module may be enabled using one of the routines
`ARKStepSetInterpolantType`, `ERKStepSetInterpolantType`, or `MRIStepSetInterpolantType`.
The serial example problem ``ark_brusselator.c`` has been converted to use this Lagrange
interpolation module.  Created accompanying routines `ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`,
`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree` and `ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree` to provide user control over
these interpolating polynomials. While the routines `ARKStepSetDenseOrder`,
`ARKStepSetDenseOrder` and `ARKStepSetDenseOrder` still exist, these have been deprecated and
will be removed in a future release.



## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.1.0

Fixed a build system bug related to finding LAPACK/BLAS.

Fixed a build system bug related to checking if the KLU library works.

Fixed a build system bug related to finding PETSc when using the CMake
variables `PETSC_INCLUDES` and `PETSC_LIBRARIES` instead of `PETSC_DIR`.

Added a new build system option, `CUDA_ARCH`, to specify the CUDA architecture to compile for.

Fixed a bug in the Fortran 2003 interfaces to the ARKode Butcher table routines and structure.
This includes changing the `ARKodeButcherTable` type to be a `type(c_ptr)` in Fortran.

Added two utility functions, `SUNDIALSFileOpen` and `SUNDIALSFileClose` for creating/destroying
file pointers. These are useful when using the Fortran 2003 interfaces.

Added support for a user-supplied function to update the prediction for each
implicit stage solution in ARKStep.  If supplied, this routine will be called
*after* any existing ARKStep predictor algorithm completes, so that the
predictor may be modified by the user as desired.  The new user-supplied routine
has type `ARKStepStagePredictFn`, and may be set by calling `ARKStepSetStagePredictFn`.

The MRIStep module has been updated to support attaching different user data
pointers to the inner and outer integrators. If applicable, user codes will
need to add a call to `ARKStepSetUserData` to attach their user data
pointer to the inner integrator memory as `MRIStepSetUserData` will
not set the pointer for both the inner and outer integrators. The MRIStep
examples have been updated to reflect this change.

Added support for damping when using Anderson acceleration in KINSOL. See the
mathematical considerations section of the user guide and the description of the
`KINSetDampingAA` function for more details.

Added support for damping to the `SUNNonlinearSolver_FixedPoint` module when
using Anderson acceleration. See the `SUNNonlinearSolver_FixedPoint` section in
the user guides and the description of the `SUNNonlinSolSetDamping_FixedPoint`
function for more details.


## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.0.0

### Build System

Increased the minimum required CMake version to 3.5 for most SUNDIALS
configurations, and 3.10 when CUDA or OpenMP with device offloading are enabled.

The CMake option `BLAS_ENABLE` and the variable `BLAS_LIBRARIES` have been
removed to simplify builds as SUNDIALS packages do not use BLAS directly. For
third party libraries that require linking to BLAS, the path to the BLAS
library should be included in the `_LIBRARIES` variable for the third party
library e.g., `SUPERLUDIST_LIBRARIES` when enabling SuperLU_DIST.

Fixed a bug in the build system that prevented the PThreads NVECTOR module from
being built.

### NVector

Two new functions were added to aid in creating custom NVECTOR objects. The
constructor N_VNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic NVECTOR with the
object's content pointer and the function pointers in the operations structure
initialized to NULL. When used in the constructor for custom objects this function
will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the NVECTOR API by
ensuring only required operations need to be set. Additionally, the function
N_VCopyOps(w, v) has been added to copy the operation function pointers between
vector objects. When used in clone routines for custom vector objects these
functions also will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the
NVECTOR API by ensuring all operations are copied when cloning objects.

Two new N_Vector implementations, NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR and NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR,
have been created to support flexible partitioning of solution data among
different processing elements (e.g., CPU + GPU) or for multi-physics problems
that couple distinct MPI-based simulations together (see the NVECTOR_MANYVECTOR
and NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR sections in the user guides for more details). This
implementation is accompanied by additions to user documentation and SUNDIALS
examples.

An additional NVECTOR implementation, NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX, has been created to
support the MPI+X paradigm where X is a type of on-node parallelism (e.g.,
OpenMP, CUDA). The implementation is accompanied by additions to user
documentation and SUNDIALS examples.

One new required vector operation and ten new optional vector operations have
been added to the NVECTOR API. The new required operation, N_VGetLength, returns
the global length of an N_Vector. The optional operations have been added to
support the new NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR implementation. The operation
N_VGetCommunicator must be implemented by subvectors that are combined to create
an NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR, but is not used outside of this context. The
remaining nine operations are optional local reduction operations intended to
eliminate unnecessary latency when performing vector reduction operations
(norms, etc.) on distributed memory systems. The optional local reduction vector
operations are N_VDotProdLocal, N_VMaxNormLocal, N_VMinLocal, N_VL1NormLocal,
N_VWSqrSumLocal, N_VWSqrSumMaskLocal, N_VInvTestLocal, N_VConstrMaskLocal, and
N_VMinQuotientLocal. If an NVECTOR implementation defines any of the local
operations as NULL, then the NVECTOR_MPIMANYVECTOR will call standard NVECTOR
operations to complete the computation.

The *_MPICuda and *_MPIRaja functions have been removed from the NVECTOR_CUDA
and NVECTOR_RAJA implementations respectively. Accordingly, the
nvector_mpicuda.h, nvector_mpiraja.h, libsundials_nvecmpicuda.lib, and
libsundials_nvecmpicudaraja.lib files have been removed. Users should use the
NVECTOR_MPIPLUSX module in conjunction with the NVECTOR_CUDA or NVECTOR_RAJA
modules to replace the functionality. The necessary changes are minimal and
should require few code modifications.

Fixed a memory leak in the NVECTOR_PETSC clone function.

Made performance improvements to the CUDA NVECTOR. Users who utilize a non
-default stream should no longer see default stream synchronizations after
memory transfers.

Added a new constructor to the CUDA NVECTOR that allows a user to provide
custom allocate and free functions for the vector data array and internal
reduction buffer.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most NVECTOR modules. See NEVTOR section
in the user guides for more details on how to use the interfaces.

Added three new NVECTOR utility functions, `FN_VGetVecAtIndexVectorArray`,
`FN_VSetVecAtIndexVectorArray`, and `FN\_VNewVectorArray`, for working with
`N_Vector` arrays when using the Fortran 2003 interfaces.

### SUNMatrix

Two new functions were added to aid in creating custom SUNMATRIX objects. The
constructor SUNMatNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic SUNMATRIX with the
object's content pointer and the function pointers in the operations structure
initialized to NULL. When used in the constructor for custom objects this function
will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the SUNMATRIX API by
ensuring only required operations need to be set. Additionally, the function
SUNMatCopyOps(A, B) has been added to copy the operation function pointers between
matrix objects. When used in clone routines for custom matrix objects these
functions also will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the
SUNMATRIX API by ensuring all operations are copied when cloning objects.

A new operation, SUNMatMatvecSetup, was added to the SUNMatrix API. Users
who have implemented custom SUNMatrix modules will need to at least update
their code to set the corresponding ops structure member, matvecsetup, to NULL.

The generic SUNMatrix API now defines error codes to be returned by SUNMatrix operations.
Operations which return an integer flag indiciating success/failure may return different
values than previously.

A new SUNMatrix (and SUNLinearSolver) implementation was added to facilitate
the use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most SUNMATRIX modules. See SUNMATRIX
section in the user guides for more details on how to use the interfaces.

### SUNLinearSolver

A new function was added to aid in creating custom SUNLINEARSOLVER objects. The
constructor SUNLinSolNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic SUNLINEARSOLVER
with the object's content pointer and the function pointers in the operations
structure initialized to NULL. When used in the constructor for custom objects
this function will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the
SUNLINEARSOLVER API by ensuring only required operations need to be set.

The return type of the SUNLinearSolver API function `SUNLinSolLastFlag` has
changed from `long int` to `sunindextype` to be consistent with the type
used to store row indices in dense and banded linear solver modules.

Added a new optional operation to the SUNLINEARSOLVER API, `SUNLinSolGetID`,
that returns a `SUNLinearSolver_ID` for identifying the linear solver module.

The SUNLinearSolver API has been updated to make the initialize and setup
functions optional.

A new SUNLinearSolver (and SUNMatrix) implementation was added to facilitate
the use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.

Added a new SUNLinearSolver implementation, `SUNLinearSolver_cuSolverSp_batchQR`,
which leverages the NVIDIA cuSOLVER sparse batched QR method for efficiently
solving block diagonal linear systems on NVIDIA GPUs.

Added three new accessor functions to the SUNLinSol_KLU module,
`SUNLinSol_KLUGetSymbolic()`, `SUNLinSol_KLUGetNumeric()`, and
`SUNLinSol_KLUGetCommon()`, to provide user access to the underlying
KLU solver structures.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most SUNLINEARSOLVER modules. See
SUNLINEARSOLVER section in the user guides for more details on how to use
the interfaces.

### SUNNonlinearSolver

A new function was added to aid in creating custom SUNNONLINEARSOLVER objects.
The constructor SUNNonlinSolNewEmpty() allocates an ``empty'' generic
SUNNONLINEARSOLVER with the object's content pointer and the function pointers
in the operations structure initialized to NULL. When used in the constructor
for custom objects this function will ease the introduction of any new optional
operations to the SUNNONLINEARSOLVER API by ensuring only required operations
need to be set.

To facilitate the use of user supplied nonlinear solver convergence test
functions the `SUNNonlinSolSetConvTestFn` function in the SUNNonlinearSolver API
has been updated to take a `void*` data pointer as input. The supplied data
pointer will be passed to the nonlinear solver convergence test function on each
call.

The inputs values passed to the first two inputs of the `SUNNonlinSolSolve`
function in the SUNNONLINEARSOLVER have been changed to be the predicted
state and the initial guess for the correction to that state. Additionally,
the definitions of `SUNNonlinSolLSetupFn` and `SUNNonlinSolLSolveFn` in the
SUNNonlinearSolver API have been updated to remove unused input parameters.
For more information on the nonlinear system formulation and the API functions
see the SUNNONLINEARSOLVER chapter in the user guides.

Added a new `SUNNonlinearSolver` implementation, `SUNNonlinsol_PetscSNES`,
which interfaces to the PETSc SNES nonlinear solver API.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces for most SUNNONLINEARSOLVER modules. See
SUNNONLINEARSOLVER section in the user guides for more details on how to use
the interfaces.

### CVODE and CVODES

Fixed a bug in the CVODE and CVODES constraint handling where the step size
could be set below the minimum step size.

Fixed a bug in the CVODE and CVODES nonlinear solver interfaces where the norm
of the accumulated correction was not updated when using a non-default
convergence test function.

Fixed a bug in the CVODES `cvRescale` function where the loops to compute the
array of scalars for the fused vector scale operation stopped one iteration
early.

Fixed a bug in CVODES where CVodeF would return the wrong flag under certain
cirumstances.

Fixed a bug in CVODES where CVodeF would not return a root in NORMAL_STEP mode
if the root occurred after the desired output time.

Fixed a memeory leak in FCVODE when not using the default nonlinear solver.

Removed extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where the scalar valued
absolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute tolerance
array, are strictly positive. In this scenario CVODE and CVODES will remove
at least one global reduction per time step.

The CVLS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before
calling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear
solver has type `SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT`.

A new linear solver interface function, `CVLsLinSysFn`, was added as an
alternative method for evaluating the linear systems I - gamma J.

Added functions to get the current state and gamma value to CVODE and CVODES.
These functions may be useful to users who chose to provide their own nonlinear
solver implementation.

Added New Fortran 2003 interfaces to CVODE and CVODES were added. These new
interfaces were generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic
Fortran 2003 interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API. The existing CVODE F2003
interface, and all module implementations with existing Fortran 2003 interfaces
were updated accordingly. See the section "Using CVODE for Fortran
Applications" and "Using CVODES for Fortran Applications" in the appropriate
user guide for more details on how to use the interfaces.

### ARKode

The MRIStep module has been updated to support explicit, implicit, or IMEX
methods as the fast integrator using the ARKStep module. As a result some
function signatures have been changed including MRIStepCreate which now
takes an ARKStep memory structure for the fast integration as an input.

Fixed a bug in the ARKStep time-stepping module in ARKode that would result in an
infinite loop if the nonlinear solver failed to converge more than the maximum
allowed times during a single step.

Fixed a bug in ARKode that would result in a "too much accuracy requested" error
when using fixed time step sizes with explicit methods in some cases.

Fixed a bug in ARKStep where the mass matrix linear solver setup function was
not called in the Matrix-free case.

Fixed a minor bug in ARKStep where an incorrect flag is reported when an
error occurs in the mass matrix setup or Jacobian-vector product setup
functions.

Fixed a memeory leak in FARKODE when not using the default nonlinear solver.

The reinitialization functions `ERKStepReInit()`, `ARKStepReInit()`, and
`MRIStepReInit()` have been updated to retain the minimum and maxiumum step
size values from before reinitialization rather than resetting them to the
default values.

Removed extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where the scalar valued
absolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute tolerance
array, are strictly positive. In this scenario ARKode steppers will remove
at least one global reduction per time step.

The ARKLS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before
calling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear
solver has type `SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT`.

A new linear solver interface function, `ARKLsLinSysFn`, was added as an
alternative method for evaluating the linear systems M - gamma J and
I - gamma J.

Added two new embedded ARK methods of orders 4 and 5 to ARKode (from
Kennedy & Carpenter, Appl. Numer. Math., 136:183--205, 2019).

Support for optional inequality constraints on individual components of the
solution vector has been added the ARKode ERKStep and ARKStep modules. See
the descriptions of ERKStepSetConstraints and ARKStepSetConstraints for
more details. Note that enabling constraint handling requires the NVECTOR
operations N_VMinQuotient, N_VConstrMask, and N_VCompare that were not
previously required by ARKode.

Added functions to get the current state and gamma value to the ARKStep module.
These functions may be useful to users who chose to provide their own nonlinear
solver implementation.

Add two new 'Set' functions to MRIStep, `MRIStepSetPreInnerFn()` and
`MRIStepSetPostInnerFn()` for performing communication or memory
transfers needed before or after the inner integration.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces to all ARKode stepper modules. These new
interfaces were generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic
Fortran 2003 interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API. See the section "Using
ARKode for Fortran Applications" in the user guide for more details on how
to use the interfaces.

### IDA and IDAS

A bug was fixed in the IDA and IDAS linear solver interfaces where an incorrect
Jacobian-vector product increment was used with iterative solvers other than
SPGMR and SPFGMR.

Fixed a bug in IDAS where IDASolveF would return the wrong flag under certain
cirumstances.

Fixed a bug in IDAS where IDASolveF would not return a root in NORMAL_STEP mode
if the root occurred after the desired output time.

Fixed a bug the IDAS IDAQuadReInitB function where an incorrect memory structure
was passed to IDAQuadReInit.

Fixed a memeory leak in FIDA when not using the default nonlinear solver.

Removed extraneous calls to N_VMin() for simulations where the scalar valued
absolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute tolerance
array, are strictly positive. In this scenario IDA and IDAS will remove
at least one global reduction per time step.

The IDALS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before
calling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear
solver has type SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces to IDA and IDAS. These new interfaces were
generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic Fortran 2003
interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API.  See the section "Using IDA for Fortran
Applications" and "Using IDAS for Fortran Applications" in the appropriate
user guide for more details on how to use the interfaces.

### KINSOL

Fixed a bug in the KINSOL linear solver interface where the auxiliary scalar
`sJpnorm` was not computed when necessary with the Picard iteration and the
auxiliary scalar `sFdotJp` was unnecessarily computed in some cases.

The KINLS interface has been updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before
calling a user-supplied Jacobian evaluation function when the attached linear
solver has type SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces to KINSOL. These new interfaces were
generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an idiomatic Fortran 2003
interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API.  See the section "Using KINSOL for
Fortran Applications" for more details on how to use the interfaces.



## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.1.0

An additional N_Vector implementation was added for Tpetra vector from
Trilinos library to facilitate interoperability between SUNDIALS and Trilinos.
This implementation is accompanied by additions to user documentation and
SUNDIALS examples.

A bug was fixed where a nonlinear solver object could be freed twice in some use
cases.

The EXAMPLES_ENABLE_RAJA CMake option has been removed. The option EXAMPLES_ENABLE_CUDA
enables all examples that use CUDA including the RAJA examples with a CUDA back end (if the RAJA
NVECTOR is enabled).

The implementation header files (e.g. arkode_impl.h) are no longer installed. This means users
who are directly manipulating package memory structures will need to update their code
to use the package's public API.

Python is no longer required to run make test and make test_install.

Fixed a bug in ARKodeButcherTable_Write when printing a Butcher table
without an embedding.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.0.2

Added information on how to contribute to SUNDIALS and a contributing agreement.

Moved definitions of DLS and SPILS backwards compatibility functions to a source file.
The symbols are now included in the appropriate package library, e.g. libsundials_cvode.lib.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.0.1

A bug in ARKODE where single precision builds would fail to compile has been fixed.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.0.0

The direct and iterative linear solver interfaces in all SUNDIALS packages have
been merged into a single unified linear solver interface to support any valid
SUNLINSOL module. This includes the DIRECT and ITERATIVE types as well as the
new MATRIX_ITERATIVE type. Details regarding how SUNDIALS packages utilize linear
solvers of each type as well as discussion regarding intended use cases for
user-supplied SUNLINSOL implementations are included in the SUNLINSOL chapter of
the user guides. All example programs have been updated to use the new unified
interfaces.

The unified interface is very similar to the previous DLS and SPILS interfaces.
To minimize challenges in user migration to the unified linear solver interface,
the previous DLS and SPILS routines for all packages may still be used; these
will be deprecated in future releases, so we recommend that users migrate to the
new names soon. Additionally, we note that Fortran users will need to enlarge
their iout array of optional integer outputs, and update the indices that they
query for certain linear-solver-related statistics.

The names of all constructor routines for SUNDIALS-provided SUNLinSol
implementations have been updated to follow the naming convention SUNLinSol_*
where * is the name of the linear solver e.g., Dense, KLU, SPGMR, PCG, etc.
Solver-specific ``set'' routine names have been similarly standardized. To
minimize challenges in user migration to the new names, the previous routine
names may still be used; these will be deprecated in future releases, so we
recommend that users migrate to the new names soon. All example programs have
been updated to used the new naming convention.

The SUNBandMatrix constructor has been simplified to remove the storage upper
bandwidth argument.

SUNDIALS integrators (ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, and IDAS) have been updated to
utilize generic nonlinear solver modules through the SUNNONLINSOL API. This API
will ease the addition of new nonlinear solver options and allow for external or
user-supplied nonlinear solvers. The SUNNONLINSOL API and provided SUNNONLINSOL
modules are described in a new user guide chapter and follow the same object
oriented design and implementation used by the NVECTOR, SUNMATRIX, and
SUNLINSOL modules. All integrator example programs have also been updated to
used the new nonlinear solver API.

Three fused vector operations and seven vector array operations have been added
to the NVECTOR API. These optional operations are disabled by default and may be
activated by calling vector specific routines after creating an NVECTOR. See the
NVECTOR chapter in the user guides for more information on the new operations.

Added a new NVECTOR (NVECTOR_OPENMPDEV) which leverages OpenMP 4.5+ device offloading.

Multiple updates to the CUDA NVECTOR were made:

* Changed the N_VMake_Cuda function to take a host data pointer and a device
  data pointer instead of an N_VectorContent_Cuda object.

* Changed N_VGetLength_Cuda to return the global vector length instead of
  the local vector length.

* Added N_VGetLocalLength_Cuda to return the local vector length.

* Added N_VGetMPIComm_Cuda to return the MPI communicator used.

* Removed the accessor functions in the namespace suncudavec.

* Added the ability to set the cudaStream_t used for execution of the CUDA
  NVECTOR kernels. See the function N_VSetCudaStreams_Cuda.

* Added N_VNewManaged_Cuda, N_VMakeManaged_Cuda, and N_VIsManagedMemory_Cuda
  functions to accommodate using managed memory with the CUDA NVECTOR.

Multiple updates to the RAJA NVECTOR were made:

* Changed N_VGetLength_Raja to return the global vector length instead of
  the local vector length.

* Added N_VGetLocalLength_Raja to return the local vector length.

* Added N_VGetMPIComm_Raja to return the MPI communicator used.

* Removed the accessor functions in the namespace sunrajavec.

Two changes were made in the CVODE/CVODES/ARKODE initial step size algorithm:

  1. Fixed an efficiency bug where an extra call to the RHS function was made.
  2. Changed the behavior of the algorithm if the max-iterations case is hit.
     Before the algorithm would exit with the step size calculated on the
     penultimate iteration. Now it will exit with the step size calculated
     on the final iteration.

Fortran 2003 interfaces to CVODE, the fixed-point and Newton nonlinear solvers,
the dense, band, KLU, PCG, SPBCGS, SPFGMR, SPGMR, and SPTFQMR linear solvers,
and the serial, PThreads, and OpenMP NVECTORs have been added.

The ARKode library has been entirely rewritten to support a modular approach to
one-step methods, which should allow for rapid research and development of novel
integration methods without affecting existing solver functionality.

A new ARKode stepper, MRIStep, has been added for two rate explicit-explicit
multirate infinitesimal step methods.

ARKode's dense output infrastructure has been improved to support higher-degree
Hermite polynomial interpolants (up to degree 5) over the last successful time step.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.2.1

* Fixed a bug in the CUDA NVECTOR where the N_VInvTest operation could write
  beyond the allocated vector data.

* Fixed library installation path for multiarch systems. This fix changes the default
  library installation path to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR
  from CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib. CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR is automatically set, but is
  available as a CMAKE option that can modified.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.2.0

* Fixed problem with index types which would occur with some compilers
  (e.g. armclang) that did not define __STDC_VERSION__. The fix includes
  a depcrecation of the current behavior of the SUNDIALS_INDEX_TYPE
  CMake option.

* Fixed a thread-safety issue in CVODES and IDAS when using adjoint sensitivity
  analysis.

* Added hybrid MPI/CUDA and MPI/RAJA vectors to allow use of more than one
  MPI rank when using a GPU system.  The vectors assume one GPU device per
  MPI rank.

* Changed the name of the RAJA nvector library to libsundials_nveccudaraja.lib
  from libsundials_nvecraja.lib to better reflect that we only support
  CUDA as a backend for RAJA currently.

* Increased CMake minimum version to 3.1.3

* Add constraint handling feature to CVODE and CVODES.

* Fixed a bug in IDAS where the saved residual value used in the nonlinear
  solve for consistent initial conditions was passed as temporary workspace and
  could be overwritten.

* Several changes were made to the build system. If MPI is enabled and MPI
  compiler wrappers are not set, the build system will check if
  `CMAKE_<language>_COMPILER` can compile MPI programs before trying to locate and
  use an MPI installation. The native CMake FindMPI module is now used to locate
  an MPI installation. The options for setting MPI compiler wrappers and the
  executable for running MPI programs have been updated to align with those in
  native CMake FindMPI module. This included changing MPI_MPICC to MPI_C_COMPILER,
  MPI_MPICXX to MPI_CXX_COMPILER combining MPI_MPIF77 and MPI_MPIF90 to
  MPI_Fortran_COMPILER, and changing MPI_RUN_COMMAND to MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE. When a
  Fortran name-mangling scheme is needed (e.g., LAPACK_ENABLE is ON) the build system
  will infer the scheme from the Fortran compiler. If a Fortran compiler is not
  available or the inferred or default scheme needs to be overridden, the advanced
  options SUNDIALS_F77_FUNC_CASE and SUNDIALS_F77_FUNC_UNDERSCORES can be used to
  manually set the name-mangling scheme and bypass trying to infer the scheme.
  Additionally, parts of the main CMakeLists.txt file were moved to new files in
  the src and example directories to make the CMake configuration file structure
  more modular.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.1.2

* Fixed Windows specific problem where sunindextype was not correctly
  defined when using 64-bit integers for the sundials index type. On Windows
  sunindextype is now defined as the MSVC basic type __int64.

* Changed LICENSE install path to instdir/include/sundials

* Updated the minimum required version of CMake to 2.8.12 and enabled
  using rpath by default to locate shared libraries on OSX.

* The misnamed function CVSpilsSetJacTimesSetupFnBS in cvodes has been deprecated
  and replaced by CVSpilsSetJacTimesBS. The deprecated function
  CVSpilsSetJacTimesSetupFnBS will be removed in the next major release.

* Added and updated usage-notes examples from the SUNDIALS website to work with
  SUNDIALS 3.x. The new examples are cvode/cvDisc_dns.c cvode/cvRoberts_dns_negsol.c
  and cvodes/cvsRoberts_FSA_dns_Switch.c.

* Added sparse SUNMatrix "Reallocate" routine to allow specification
  of the nonzero storage.

* Updated the KLU SUNLinearSolver module to set constants for the two
  reinitialization types, and fixed a bug in the full reinitialization
  approach where the sparse SUNMatrix pointer would go out of scope on
  some architectures.

* Updated the "ScaleAdd" and "ScaleAddI" implementations in the sparse
  SUNMatrix module to more optimally handle the case where the target
  matrix contained sufficient storage for the sum, but had the wrong
  sparsity pattern.  The sum now occurs in-place, by performing the
  sum backwards in the existing storage.  However, it is still more
  efficient if the user-supplied Jacobian routine allocates storage
  for the sum $I+\gamma J$ or $M+\gamma J$ manually (with zero entries
  if needed).

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.1.1

* Fixed a minor bug in the CVODE and CVODES cvSLdet routine, where a
  return was missing in the error check for three inconsistent roots.

* Fixed a potential memory leak in the SPGMR and SPFGMR linear
  solvers: if "Initialize" was called multiple times then the solver
  memory was reallocated (without being freed).

* Fixed a minor bug in the ARKReInit routine, where a flag was
  incorrectly set to indicate that the problem had been resized
  (instead of just re-initialized).

* Fixed C++11 compiler errors/warnings about incompatible use of
  string literals.

* Updated KLU SUNLinearSolver module to use a typedef for the
  precision-specific solve function to be used (to avoid compiler
  warnings).

* Added missing typecasts for some (void*) pointers (again, to avoid
  compiler warnings).

* Bugfix in sunmatrix_sparse.c where we had used 'int' instead of
  'sunindextype' in one location.

* Fixed a minor bug in KINPrintInfo where a case was missing for
  KIN_REPTD_SYSFUNC_ERR leading to an undefined info message.

* Added missing `#include <stdio.h>` in NVECTOR and SUNMATRIX
  header files.

* Added missing prototypes for ARKSpilsGetNumMTSetups in ARKode and
  IDASpilsGetNumJTSetupEvals in IDA and IDAS.

* Fixed an indexing bug in the CUDA NVECTOR implementation of
  N_VWrmsNormMask and revised the RAJA NVECTOR implementation of
  N_VWrmsNormMask to work with mask arrays using values other than
  zero or one. Replaced doubles with realtypes in the RAJA vector
  test functions.

* Fixed compilation issue with GCC 7.3.0 and Fortran programs that do
  not require a SUNMatrix or SUNLinearSolver module (e.g. iterative
  linear solvers, explicit methods in ARKode, functional iteration
  in CVODE, etc.).

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.1.0

* Added NVECTOR print functions that write vector data to a specified
  file (e.g., N_VPrintFile_Serial).

* Added 'make test' and 'make test_install' options to the build system for
  testing SUNDIALS after building with 'make' and installing with 'make install'
  respectively.

* Added "Changes in ..." (latest version) to Intro. in all User Guides.

## Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.0.0

* New linear solver API and interfaces for all SUNDIALS packages and
  linear solvers

* Refactored all matrix and linear solver interfaces in SUNDIALS
* Implemented new interfaces in all 6 SUNDIALS Packages
* Corresponding updates to all example programs released with SUNDIALS
The goal of the redesign of these interfaces was to provide more encapsulation
and ease in interfacing custom linear solvers and interoperability
with linear solver libraries.
* Specific changes include:
  * Added generic SUNMATRIX module with three provided implementations:
    dense, banded and sparse.  These replicate previous SUNDIALS Dls and
    Sls matrix structures in a single object-oriented API.
  * Added example problems demonstrating use of generic SUNMATRIX modules.
  * Added generic SUNLINEARSOLVER module with eleven provided
    implementations: dense, banded, LAPACK dense, LAPACK band, KLU,
    SuperLU_MT, SPGMR, SPBCGS, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR, PCG.  These replicate
    previous SUNDIALS generic linear solvers in a single object-oriented
    API.
  * Added example problems demonstrating use of generic SUNLINEARSOLVER
    modules.
  * Expanded package-provided direct linear solver (Dls) interfaces and
    scaled, preconditioned, iterative linear solver (Spils) interfaces
    to utilize generic SUNMATRIX and SUNLINEARSOLVER objects.
  * Removed package-specific, linear solver-specific, solver modules
    (e.g. CVDENSE, KINBAND, IDAKLU, ARKSPGMR) since their functionality
    is entirely replicated by the generic Dls/Spils interfaces and
    SUNLINEARSOLVER/SUNMATRIX modules.  The exception is CVDIAG, a
    diagonal approximate Jacobian solver available to CVODE and CVODES.
  * Converted all SUNDIALS example problems to utilize new generic
    SUNMATRIX and SUNLINEARSOLVER objects, along with updated Dls and
    Spils linear solver interfaces.
  * Added Spils interface routines to ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA and
    IDAS to allow specification of a user-provided "JTSetup" routine.
    This change supports users who wish to set up data structures for
    the user-provided Jacobian-times-vector ("JTimes") routine, and
    where the cost of one JTSetup setup per Newton iteration can be
    amortized between multiple JTimes calls.

* Two new NVECTOR modules added: for CUDA and RAJA support for GPU systems
(Information on RAJA: <https://software.llnl.gov/RAJA/> )
These vectors are supplied to provide very basic support for running
on GPU architectures.  Users are advised that these vectors both move all data
to the GPU device upon construction, and speedup will only be realized if the
user also conducts the right-hand-side function evaluation on the device.
In addition, these vectors assume the problem fits on one GPU.
For further information about RAJA, users are referred to the web site,
<https://software.llnl.gov/RAJA/.>

* Addition of sunindextype option for 32-bit or 64-bit integer data index types
within all SUNDIALS structures

  * sunindextype is defined to be int32_t or int64_t when portable types are
    supported, otherwise it is defined as int or long int.
  * The Fortran interfaces continue to use long\_int for indices, except for
    their sparse matrix interface that now uses the new sunindextype.
  * Includes interfaces to PETSc, hypre, SuperLU_MT, and KLU with
    either 32-bit or 64-bit capabilities depending how the user configures
    SUNDIALS.

* To avoid potential namespace conflicts, the macros defining booleantype
values TRUE and FALSE have been changed to SUNTRUE and SUNFALSE respectively.

* Temporary vectors were removed from preconditioner setup and solve
routines for all packages.  It is assumed that all necessary data
for user-provided preconditioner operations will be allocated and
stored in user-provided data structures.

* The file include/sundials\_fconfig.h was added.  This file contains
SUNDIALS type information for use in Fortran programs.

* Added support for many xSDK-compliant build system keys
(Information on xSDK compliance: <https://xsdk.info/policies/> )
The xSDK is a movement in scientific software to provide a foundation for the
rapid and efficient production of high-quality,
sustainable extreme-scale scientific applications.  More information can
be found at <https://xsdk.info.>

* Added functions SUNDIALSGetVersion and SUNDIALSGetVersionNumber to
get SUNDIALS release version information at runtime.

* In build system:
  * Added separate BLAS_ENABLE and BLAS_LIBRARIES CMake variables
  * Additional error checking during CMake configuration
  * Fixed minor CMake bugs
  * Renamed CMake options to enable/disable examples for greater clarity
    and added option to enable/disable Fortran 77 examples
    * Changed EXAMPLES_ENABLE to EXAMPLES_ENABLE_C
    * Changed CXX_ENABLE to EXAMPLES_ENABLE_CXX
    * Changed F90_ENABLE to EXAMPLES_ENABLE_F90
    * Added EXAMPLES_ENABLE_F77 option

* Corrections and additions to all User Guides.

* Added "Changes in ..." (latest version) to Intro. in all User Guides.

ARKode:

* Added comments to arkode_butcher.c regarding which methods should have
  coefficients accurate enough for use in quad precision
* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in arkode_butcher.c in use of RCONST
* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in in the arkInitialSetup utility routine in the
  order of operations when setting up and using mass matrices
  to ensure the mass matrix vector product is set up before the "msetup"
  routine is called.
* Fixed ARKode printf-related compiler warnings when building SUNDIALS
  with extended precision.

CVODE and CVODES:

* Bug Fix: In CVodeFree, now call lfree() unconditionally (if non-NULL).

IDA and IDAS:

* Bug Fix: Added missing prototype for IDASetMaxBacksIC in ida.h and idas.h

KINSOL:

* Bug Fix: Corrected KINSOL fcmix name translation for FKIN_SPFGMR
* Renamed KINLocalFn and KINCommFn to KINBBDLocalFn and KINBBDCommFn
  respectively in the BBD preconditioner module for consistency with
  other SUNDIALS solvers.

* Maximum number of Butcher table stages was increased from 8 to 15 to accommodate very high order methods, and an 8th-order adaptive ERK method was added.
* Added support for the explicit and implicit methods in an additive Runge-Kutta method to utilize different stage times, solution and embedding coefficients, to support new SSP-ARK methods.
