# SUNDIALS Testing

SUNDIALS utilizes CTest to build and run the example programs distributed with
SUNDIALS as a test suite. In order to run the tests SUNDIALS examples must be
enabled by setting the CMake options `EXAMPLES_ENABLE_<language>` to `ON`.

To run the standard C tests use the following commands:
```
mkdir <build directory>
cd <build directory>
cmake <sundials directory> \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> \
  -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE_C=ON
make
make test
```
This will create an out of source build, build SUNDIALS and all the C examples,
and run the tests (which are the examples) that return a pass/fail status. All
output is saved to the file `<build directory>/Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log`.

### Development Test

Examples that do not return a pass/fail status are considered "development" only
tests and are excluded by default when running `make test`. To enable all
examples when testing set the CMake option `SUNDIALS_TEST_DEVTESTS` to `ON`.
With this option enabled tests are run using a Python test runner
`test/testRunner`. The test runner determines if a test passes or fails by
comparing the test output against saved output files that are deemed correct by
the SUNDIALS team.

To run the development C tests use the following commands:
```
mkdir <build directory>
cd <build directory>
cmake <sundials directory> \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> \
  -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE_C=ON \
  -DSUNDIALS_TEST_DEVTESTS=ON
make
make test
```
This will create an out of source build, build SUNDIALS and all the C examples,
and run all the tests (which are the examples). The output from each test is
saved to `<build directory>/Testing/output`.

The saved output files are machine specific and may produce erroneous failures
when run on different systems. New output files for a different machine can be
generated by redirecting the test output to a machine specific answer directory
using the `SUNDIALS_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR` cache variable. This file can then be set
as the answer directory when running subsequent tests using the
`SUNDIALS_TEST_ANSWER_DIR` cache variable.

For example the test output can be redirected to `<machine output directory>`
using the following commands:
```
cd <build directory>
cmake <sundials directory> \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> \
  -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE_C=ON \
  -DSUNDIALS_TEST_DEVTESTS=ON \
  -DSUNDIALS_TEST_OUTPUT_DIR=<machine output directory>
make
make test
```
The `<machine output directory>` can then be set as the test answer directory
using the following commands:
```
cd <build directory>
cmake <sundials directory> \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> \
  -DEXAMPLES_ENABLE_C=ON \
  -DSUNDIALS_TEST_DEVTESTS=ON \
  -DSUNDIALS_TEST_ANSWER_DIR=<machine output directory>
make
make test
```

## Testing Scripts

Several shell scripts are provided for setting up and running SUNDIALS tests and
are used with continuous integration tools to test each push and pull-request to
the SUNDIALS repository. The primary driver script is `test_driver.sh` which
selects which test type to run (BRANCH, PR, or RELEASE) and calls one of three
driver scripts corresponding to the test type:
* BRANCH tests (`test_branch.sh`) are run on each push to a branch in the
SUNDIALS repository.
* PR tests (`test_pr.sh`) are run for each pull-request issued to the SUNDIALS
repository.
* RELEASE tests (`test_release.sh`) are run for each push to a release branch or
release pull-request.

The BRANCH, PR, and RELEASE scripts call one or more of the following test
scripts to configure, build, and test SUNDIALS:
* `suntest.sh` -- tests configured using standard options
* `suntest_xsdk.sh` -- tests configured using xSDK options
* `suntest_tarscript.sh` -- create tarballs and test with standard options

Any of the test scripts may be called independently of the driver scripts for
manual testing. See the comment block at the top of each file for more
information on running the scripts.

Note: At this time the testing scripts only run development tests when SUNDIALS
is configured with real type double (either index size can be used).

### Testing environment

To setup the testing environment the test scripts will source one of the
following environment scripts (listed in the order checked):

1. The script specified by the environment variable `SUNDIALS_ENV`
2. A user's local environment script: `<sunrepo>/test/env.sh`
3. A user's global environment script: `~/.sundials_config/env.sh`
4. The default SUNDIALS environment script: `<sunrepo>/test/env.default.sh`

Environment scripts must set the following environment variables that are used
when configuring SUNDIALS for testing.
```
CC  = C compiler
CXX = C++ compiler
FC  = Fortran compiler

CFLAGS   = C compiler flags
CXXFLAGS = C++ compiler flags
FFLAGS   = Fortran compiler flags
```
Note the test scripts will append the C standard flag (`-std=c90` or `-std=c99`)
and C++ standard flag (`-std=c++11`) to the compiler flags provided by the
environment variables.

An environment script may optionally set additional environment variables to
enable or disable third party libraries (TPLs) in the SUNDIALS configuration.
Variables of the form `<TPL>_STATUS` enable or disable the corresponding TPL
when set to `ON` or `OFF` respectively. Note `<TPL>_STATUS` variables default to
`OFF` if they are not set. Depending on the particular TPL, a variable of the
from `<TPL>DIR` or `<TPL>LIBS` must be set when `<TPL>_STATUS = ON` to provide
the full path to the the TPL installation directory or the list of TPL libraries
to link to respectively.

The currently supported TPL environment variables are as follows:
```
# Enable/disable MPI support
MPI_STATUS = ON or OFF
MPICC      = MPI C compiler wrapper
MPICXX     = MPI C++ compiler wrapper
MPIFC      = MPI Fortran compiler wrapper
MPIEXEC    = executable for launching MPI runs

# Enable/disable PThread support
PTHREAD_STATUS = ON or OFF

# Enable/disable OpenMP support
OPENMP_STATUS = ON or OFF

# Enable/disable OpenMP device offloading support
OPENMPDEV_STATUS = ON or OFF

# Enable/disable CUDA support
CUDA_STATUS = ON or OFF

# Enable/disable LAPACK linear solvers
LAPACK_STATUS = ON or OFF
LAPACKLIBS    = full path to LAPACK library

# Enable/disable KLU linear solver
KLU_STATUS = ON or OFF
KLUDIR     = full path to KLU installation

# Enable/disable SuperLU_MT linear solver
SLUMT_STATUS = ON or OFF
SLUMTDIR     = full path to SuperLU_MT installation

# Enable/disable SuperLU_DIST linear solver
SLUDIST_STATUS = ON or OFF
SLUDISTDIR     = full path to SuperLU_DIST installation

# Enable/disable hypre support
HYPRE_STATUS = ON or OFF
HYPREDIR     = full path to hypre installation

# Enable/disable PETSc support
PETSCSTATUS = ON or OFF
PETSCDIR    = full path to PETSc installation

# Enable/disable Trilinos support
TRILINOS_STATUS = ON or OFF
TRILINOSDIR     = full path to Trilinos installation

# Enable/disable RAJA support
RAJA_STATUS = ON or OFF
RAJADIR     = full path to RAJA installation
```

To aid in setting the above variables appropriately, the test scripts pass the
real type (`single`, `double`, or `extended`) and the index size (`32` or `64`)
SUNDIALS will be configured with as the first and second inputs to the
environment script respectively. Additionally, the test scripts may optionally
pass a compiler spec (e.g., `gcc@4.9.4`) and a build type (e.g., `opt` for an
optimized build) as the third and fourth inputs respectively.

## Using Spack to install TPLs

The TPLs needed for a complete build of SUNDIALS can be easily installed with
spack and the spack environment included in the SUNDIALS repository. Simply
navigate to `test/spack` and run `spack install`. For more information on Spack
environments is the [Spack tutorial](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_environments.html).
